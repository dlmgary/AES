# AES-512 Cryptology Project

This is a custom implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using Python. The main features of this implementation include:

- Encryption/Decryption
- 18 cycles
- 512 bit key
- No use of external libraries
- Performance measurer (timer) 

## Resources 
This implementation was implemented using the standard:

- FIPS PUB 197: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf)
