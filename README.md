# AES-512 Cryptology Project

This is a custom implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using Python. The main features of this implementation include:

- Encryption/Decryption
- 16 cycles
- 128 bit block sequency 
- 512 bit key
- No use of external libraries
- Performance measurer (timer) 
- Usable for all printable characters

This implementation was implemented using the standards:

- FIPS PUB 197: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf)
- ISO/IEC 18033-3: Information technology – Security techniques – Encryption algorithms – Part 3: Block ciphers (https://www.iso.org/standard/54531.html)
